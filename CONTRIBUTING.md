## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this agreement simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to [https://cla.developers.google.com](https://cla.developers.google.com) to see

## Create a pull request

When making pull requests to the repository, make sure to follow these guidelines for both bug fixes and new features:

- Before creating a pull request, file a GitHub Issue so that maintainers and the community can discuss the problem and potential solutions before you spend time on an implementation.
- In your PR's description, link to any related issues or pull requests to give reviewers the full context of your change.
- For commit messages, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

### Features

Before creating pull requests for new features, first file a GitHub Issue describing the reasoning and motivation for the feature. This gives maintainers and the community the opportunity to provide feedback on your idea before implementing it.
